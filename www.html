    <h1>World Wide Web</h1>
    <h3>What is World Wide Web (WWW, W3)?</h3>
    <p>The World Wide Web -- also known as the web, WWW or W3 -- refers to all the public websites or pages that users
        can access on their local computers and other devices through the internet. These pages and documents are
        interconnected by means of hyperlinks that users click on for information.
        This information can be in different formats, including text, images, audio and video.
        The term World Wide Web isn't synonymous with the internet. Rather, the World Wide Web is part of the internet.

    <h3>How does the World Wide Web work?</h3>
    <p>Paving the way for an internet revolution that has transformed the world in only three decades, the World Wide
        Web consists of multiple components that enable users to access various resources, documents and web pages on
        the internet.
        Thus, the WWW is like a vast electronic book whose pages are stored or hosted on different servers worldwide.
        <br>
        These pages are the primary component or building blocks of the WWW and are linked through hyperlinks, which
        provide access from one specific spot in a hypertext or hypermedia document to another spot within that document
        or a different one. Hyperlinks are another defining concept of the WWW and provide its identity as a collection
        of interconnected documents.
